Lab Project – Microsoft 365 Compliance & Security Management

This project focused on configuring and managing compliance and security tools within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. The objective was to simulate the role of a security and compliance administrator by implementing data protection, retention, alerting, and auditing features.

Project Summary

To gain practical experience with Microsoft 365’s built-in compliance and security capabilities, I performed several tasks using the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center and Microsoft Defender portal. These included setting up data loss prevention, retention policies, real-time security alerts, and audit log tracking—all essential for safeguarding organizational data and maintaining regulatory compliance.

What I Did

1. Configured Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policies
    •    Accessed the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center and created a new DLP policy to protect sensitive data, such as credit card numbers.
    •    Configured the policy to automatically notify users when sensitive data was detected in email content.
    •    Tested the policy by sending a sample email containing a mock credit card number to trigger the rule and confirm that the notification system worked.

2. Implemented Retention Policies
    •    Navigated to the Data Lifecycle Management section.
    •    Created a retention policy for emails and documents, setting specific retention durations to meet compliance requirements.
    •    Applied the policy to a selected user group and verified its application by checking the retention status of files and messages within user accounts.

3. Set Up and Verified Security Alerts
    •    Accessed the Microsoft Defender Security Center.
    •    Created a medium severity alert policy to monitor user behavior—specifically, when mail forwarding or redirect rules were created.
    •    Configured alert notifications to be sent to an administrator.
    •    Simulated suspicious behavior (e.g., setting up an auto-forwarding rule) to trigger the alert and validated that it was properly logged and notified.

4. Enabled and Used Audit Logs
    •    Enabled audit logging in the Compliance Center to begin capturing activity data.
    •    Searched the audit logs for specific user actions such as file deletions.
    •    Exported the audit logs for offline analysis and reviewed them to identify any irregularities or unauthorized activity within the tenant.
