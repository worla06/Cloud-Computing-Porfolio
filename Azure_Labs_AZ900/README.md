Azure Fundamentals & Core Services – Challenge Labs (AZ-900 Series)

As part of my Microsoft Azure Fundamentals training, I completed a series of practical challenge labs designed to provide hands-on experience with essential Azure services. These labs reinforced the core concepts of cloud computing, infrastructure provisioning, and service management using tools such as the Azure Portal, ARM templates, Azure CLI, and Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).

Completed Challenge Labs

⸻

Lab 1 – Implementing an Azure Load Balancer

Module: Core Azure Services (AZ300.2-007)
In this lab, I deployed and configured an Azure Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple virtual machines for high availability. I worked with backend pools, health probes, and load balancing rules to simulate real-world traffic management and service redundancy.

⸻

Lab 2 – Resource Deployment with ARM Templates

Module: Core Azure Services (AZ900-001)
I created and deployed Azure resources using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. This exercise enhanced my skills in infrastructure-as-code (IaC) by allowing me to define network and compute configurations declaratively, ensuring repeatability and consistency in deployments.

⸻

Lab 3 – Running Commands with Azure Cloud Shell

Module: Core Azure Services (AZ900-003)
Using Azure Cloud Shell, I executed a variety of Azure CLI commands to manage resources directly from the browser. This task improved my command-line proficiency and introduced me to automation-friendly workflows in Azure’s native shell environment.

Lab 4 – Configuring Route Tables in Azure

Module: Core Azure Services
I created and configured a custom route table within Azure Virtual Networks. This involved defining user-defined routes (UDRs) and associating them with subnets to manage traffic flow between resources, demonstrating control over network architecture.

⸻

Lab 5 – Installing and Configuring Microsoft Entra ID Connect

Module: IaaS Services (AZ300.3-001)
In this identity-focused lab, I installed and configured Microsoft Entra ID Connect to synchronize on-premises Active Directory users with Azure AD. I gained practical experience with hybrid identity solutions and secure user provisioning.

⸻

Lab 6 – Azure Cost Management and Pricing

Module: Azure Pricing & Support (AZ900-015)
This lab focused on Azure Cost Management tools, where I analyzed resource usage, configured budgets, and created cost alerts. I explored the Azure Pricing Calculator and Cost Analysis features to ensure efficient financial management in the cloud.
